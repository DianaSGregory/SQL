For this project I worked with the "chinook" database.
The database and information about it can be found at the following link: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/
Here is a comprehensive list of my questions and answers based on this particular database:

1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT
CustomerID,
FirstName,
LastName,
Country
from Chinook.Customers
where country !='US';

2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT
CustomerID,
FirstName,
LastName,
Country
from Chinook.Customers
where country ='Brazil';

3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT
Customers.FirstName,
Customers.LastName,
Invoice.InvoiceId,
Invoice.InvoiceDate,
Invoice.BillingCountry
from chinook.invoices Invoice
left join chinook.customers Customers
on invoice.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID
where invoice.Billingcountry ='Brazil'


4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
Select 
*
from Chinook.employees
where Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT
Distinct(BillingCountry)
from Chinook.invoices

6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT
employees.LastName,
employees.FirstName,
employees.Title,
invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.invoices invoices
join chinook.customers customers
on invoices.invoiceid=customers.CustomerID
join chinook.employees employees
on customers.Supportrepid=employees.employeeId
where employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' ;

7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT
Inv.Total,
Cust.FirstName,
Cust.LastName,
Cust.Country,
Empl.FirstName,
Empl.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices Inv
join chinook.customers Cust
on Inv.InvoiceID=Cust.CustomerId
join chinook.employees Empl
on Cust.supportrepID=Empl.Employeeid;

8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT
Count(InvoiceID) as TotalInv
from chinook.invoices
where Invoicedate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

9.What are the total sales for 2009?
Select
Sum(total) as TotalSales
from chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT 
tracks.Name,
Invit.InvoiceLineID
from chinook.tracks tracks
join chinook.invoice_items Invit
on tracks.TrackId=Invit.TrackId;

11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT
a.name,
t.name,
i.invoiceLineId
from chinook.invoice_items i
left join chinook.tracks t
on i.TrackId=t.TrackId
inner join chinook.albums al
on t.AlbumId=al.Albumid
left join chinook.artists a
on a.ArtistId=al.ArtistID;

12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT
t.name as TrackName,
a.Title as AlbumName,
mt.Name as MediaType,
g.Name as Genre
from chinook.tracks t
left join chinook.genres g
on t.GenreId=g.GenreId
left join chinook.media_types mt
on mt.MediaTypeId=t.MediaTypeId
left join chinook.albums a
on a.Albumid=t.AlbumId;

13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT
e.LastName,
e.FirstName,
e.title,
Round(Sum(i.Total))as TotalSales
from chinook.customers c
join chinook.employees e
on c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId
join invoices i
on i.InvoiceId=c.CustomerId
where e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
group by e.LastName;

14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
